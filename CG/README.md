# CG
Solves a linear system *Ax = b* using the **conjugate gradient** method.

## Input
Expects *A* to be stored in matrix `[A]`, *b* in `[B]` and the initial guess *x_0* in `[C]`.

## Output
Displays all steps in the calculation with formula and result.
The operations are directly applied on `[C]`, so the solution *x_n* will also be available in `[C]` afterwards.
